# <a name="mpio_devinstance_health_class-wmi-class"></a>MPIO \_ DEVINSTANCE \_ HEALTH \_ 类 WMI 类


MPIO 驱动程序使用 MPIO \_ DEVINSTANCE \_ HEALTH \_ 类 WMI 类通过特定路径报告设备的运行状况统计信息。

当 WMI 工具套件编译此类定义时，它将生成 [**MPIO \_ DEVINSTANCE \_ HEALTH \_ 类**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/mpiodisk/ns-mpiodisk-_mpio_devinstance_health_class) 数据结构。 没有与此 WMI 类相关联的方法。
